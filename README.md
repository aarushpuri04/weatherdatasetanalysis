# Weather Data Analysis

This project details a methodical approach to analyzing a comprehensive weather dataset. The 
process involves initial data cleansing, followed by detailed analysis and visualization using 
Python and Tableau, respectively. The data includes various key weather parameters such as 
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, which are crucial for understanding 
atmospheric conditions. This document aims to guide beginners through the essential data 
science processes, from manipulating raw data to creating meaningful visual representations 
and extracting actionable insights.
